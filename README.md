## âœ… **5.2 Lab â€“ Introduction to Pointers in C (GitHub Codespaces Edition)**

---

### **Introduction**

Pointers are variables that store memory addresses. They allow programs to efficiently manipulate data, support dynamic memory allocation, and enable complex data structures like linked lists. In this two-part lab, you'll explore how to use pointers, understand pointer arithmetic, and work with arrays using pointers.

---

### **Objectives**

By the end of this lab, you will:

1. Understand how to declare and initialize pointers.
2. Use the address-of (`&`) and dereference (`*`) operators.
3. Modify a variable's value using a pointer.
4. Work with multiple pointers and pointer arithmetic.
5. Use pointers to access and manipulate array elements.

## ðŸ§ª **Part 1: Basic Pointers**

---

### **Step 1: Launch GitHub Codespaces**

1. Open your GitHub repository.
2. Click **Code > Codespaces > Create codespace on main**.

---

### **Step 2: Create `pointers.c`**

1. In the Explorer pane, open: `pointers.c`
2. Verify the following code:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int x = 10;
    int *ptr;

    ptr = &x;

    printf("Value of x: %d\n", x);
    printf("Address of x: %p\n", &x);
    printf("Address stored in ptr: %p\n", ptr);
    printf("Value pointed to by ptr: %d\n", *ptr);

    *ptr = 20; // modifying x using pointer
    printf("New value of x after modification via pointer: %d\n", x);

    return 0;
}
```

---

### **Step 3: Compile and Run**

In the terminal:

```bash
gcc pointers.c -o pointers
./pointers
```

âœ… You should see the memory address of `x`, the value accessed via the pointer, and the updated value of `x`.

---

## ðŸ§ª **Part 2: Pointer Arithmetic and Arrays**

---

### **Step 4: Update Your Code**

Extend your existing program with this additional block:

```c
    // Part 2: Pointer arithmetic with arrays
    int arr[5] = {100, 200, 300, 400, 500};
    int *p = arr;

    printf("\nArray values using pointer arithmetic:\n");
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        printf("Element %d = %d (Address: %p)\n", i, *(p + i), (p + i));
    }

    // Change value using pointer
    *(p + 2) = 999;
    printf("\nUpdated 3rd element of array to: %d\n", arr[2]);
```

Now your full program should look like this:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int x = 10;
    int *ptr;

    ptr = &x;

    printf("Value of x: %d\n", x);
    printf("Address of x: %p\n", &x);
    printf("Address stored in ptr: %p\n", ptr);
    printf("Value pointed to by ptr: %d\n", *ptr);

    *ptr = 20;
    printf("New value of x after modification via pointer: %d\n", x);

    // Part 2: Pointer arithmetic with arrays
    int arr[5] = {100, 200, 300, 400, 500};
    int *p = arr;

    printf("\nArray values using pointer arithmetic:\n");
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        printf("Element %d = %d (Address: %p)\n", i, *(p + i), (p + i));
    }

    *(p + 2) = 999;
    printf("\nUpdated 3rd element of array to: %d\n", arr[2]);

    return 0;
}
```

---

### **Step 5: Recompile and Run**

```bash
gcc pointers.c -o pointers
./pointers
```

âœ… You should see:

* Array values printed using pointer arithmetic.
* The third element updated to `999`.

---

### **Summary**

In this two-part lab, you:

* Learned how to declare and use pointers.
* Used pointers to read and modify a variable's value.
* Practiced pointer arithmetic to iterate over an array.
* Used pointers to update specific array elements.

Understanding pointers is essential for mastering memory management and data structures in C. Youâ€™re now ready to tackle more advanced topics like dynamic memory allocation and pointer-to-pointer relationships!
